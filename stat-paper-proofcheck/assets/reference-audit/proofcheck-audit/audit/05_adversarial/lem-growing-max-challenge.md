# Independent challenge for `lem:growing-max`

Working only from the blinded packet, I normalized the obligation and re-read lines 13-18. Lines 14-15 are exact definition unfolding. Line 16 promotes per-fixed-j tail convergence to the maximum over 1..m_n with m_n -> infinity; no uniform tail rate, union control, or dependence structure is available in the locked hypotheses. Counterexample check: independent X_{n,j} ~ Bernoulli(1/n), m_n = n^2 satisfies every hypothesis while P(max > 1/2) = 1 - (1 - 1/n)^{n^2} -> 1. Line 17 folds the refuted line-16 claim. Verdict: incorrect, statement refuted at eps = 1/2.

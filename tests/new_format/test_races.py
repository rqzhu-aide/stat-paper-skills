"""Race fixtures for two batches meeting at one database (implementation-handoff 4.4).

Handoff 4.4 "Required race fixtures" names seven concurrency fixtures; each class below discharges one
clause of that sentence and each test's docstring says which:

* ``UnrelatedUpdateTests``              - unrelated draft updates both commit
* ``SameRecordUpdateTests``             - same-record updates conflict
* ``IncomingPremiseTests``              - an incoming premise conflicts with final-composition submission
* ``OutgoingConsumerTests``             - an outgoing consumer does not stale the supplier
* ``TheoremPartTests``                  - a theorem part conflicts with whole-result completion
* ``ResponseVersusReconciliationTests`` - a response racing reconciliation is never silently omitted
* ``RepeatedRequestTests``              - repeating a successful request returns one commit

Two further classes pin the sentences 4.3 uses to bound what a conflict is, because a core that called
everything a conflict would satisfy 4.4's refusals without being usable:

* ``CosmeticEditTests``          - a label edit conflicts with a replacement yet leaves evidence current
* ``PublicationVersusEditTests`` - a report build or usage receipt never conflicts with a mathematical edit

"Two packets from one revision" is built literally everywhere it is claimed: both packets are issued
before either batch is applied, which is meaningful because issuing a packet never commits. No test
rewrites ``expected_version`` to simulate a race. The receipt's ``rebased_from`` is asserted for the
same reason: it is non-null exactly when the packet's base revision is older than the commit's parent,
so it is the receipt's own record that the batch was prepared before the other batch landed.

Three habits keep the assertions falsifiable rather than merely green:

* every refusal goes through ``RaceCase.refuse``, which pins the documented error code, asserts the head
  revision did not move, asserts no commit row was written and asserts the refused request id is unknown
  to the commit index; each refusal test then also asserts the record it would have written is absent,
  and each conflict test applies the same edits through a replacement packet, so a core that refused
  everything would fail here rather than pass;
* every test that claims a batch "does not conflict" asserts the receipt's ``changed`` list, the stored
  record's version and body and the commit count, so a core whose writes silently did nothing fails;
* every test that claims a guard did not fire also shows, on the same database, a guard that did fire
  (or the exact membership guards the packet carries), so a core carrying no guards at all fails.

The guard sets, binding relations and progress counters below are literals read out of the core once;
they are deliberately not recomputed from ``packets``/``bindings``/``assessment`` at test time.

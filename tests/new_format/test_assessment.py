"""Behaviour tests for ``paper_core.assessment`` (architecture 9.3, record-contract 6-7, handoff 7.3).

``assessment`` is the only place where stored records become a colour. Nothing it produces is written
back, so every value here has to be reproducible from the snapshot alone: the obligation set is derived
from the registered structure and the declared audit, freshness comes from comparing a judgment's stored
binding with the snapshot, dependency support follows the recorded uses, and one reducer turns
constituents into the four presentation states that the report and ``status`` both render.

These tests pin four things the rest of the system depends on.

* The reducer's lattice. ``reduce`` is exercised directly on hand-built constituents so that every
  branch -- defect precedence, dispute, "nothing assessed", the amber reason list and its ordering --
  is checked without a database in the way, including the rule that colour follows primary work while
  independent and coordinator work only moves the indicator.
* Identity. ``obligation_id``/``key_of``/``ref_of``/``pinned_of`` are the names the projection, the
  report and the packets all agree on, so they must be stable functions of their inputs.
* The two ports named in the handoff. A changed prerequisite has to stale the judgments that consumed
  it (and only those), and a repair that merely records a restricted statement must not silently
  revalidate the dependent judgments.
* Process completeness. ``process_complete`` is a statement about *process*, not about mathematics: a
  completed audit may report a gap and still be complete, while an unmet obligation, an open source
  issue or an unreconciled dispute must all hold it back.

Scenario values (obligation counts, labels, explanations) were taken from the real API through
``support.Fixture``; the fixture is extended locally only where a scenario needs a third item, a second
use or an independent round whose outcome and exposure differ from the shared helper's.
